Save Score Functions

This module contains functions for saving scores to the unified scores database schema.
The unified schema uses a single scores table with player_id as a foreign key to the players table.

IMPORTANT NOTE (August 3, 2025):
----------------------------------
This system is configured to ONLY accept scores from TODAY'S Wordle.
All older scores (yesterday's Wordle and earlier) will be rejected.
This ensures the database remains clean and accurate, with no legacy/outdated scores.
