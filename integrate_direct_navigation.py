# Example patch showing how to integrate direct URL navigation into extraction script

# Add this import at the top of integrated_auto_update_multi_league.py
# from direct_url_only_navigation import navigate_to_thread_by_url

"""
Replace the thread search and click logic in extract_wordle_scores_multi_league() with this:

For each league in LEAGUES:
    ...
    # Instead of finding conversation threads
    # conversation_threads = find_conversation_threads(driver, league_id)
    
    # Use direct navigation to the correct thread
    thread_navigation_success = navigate_to_thread_by_url(driver, league_id)
    
    if not thread_navigation_success:
        logging.warning(f"Failed to navigate to thread for {league_name}")
        driver.save_screenshot(f"navigation_failed_{league_name.replace(' ', '_')}.png")
        continue
    
    # Wait for conversation to load
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Extract scores (this part remains the same)
    try:
        hidden_scores = extract_with_hidden_elements(driver, league_id, league_name)
        logging.info(f"Hidden element extraction found {hidden_scores} scores")
        scores_extracted = hidden_scores
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Hidden element extraction failed: {e}")
        scores_extracted = 0
    
    if scores_extracted:
        logging.info(f"Successfully extracted scores from {league_name}")
        any_scores_extracted = True
    else:
        logging.warning(f"No scores extracted from {league_name}")
    
    # Continue with the rest of the extraction code...
"""

# These changes will completely replace the thread identification and clicking logic
# with direct URL navigation, which should eliminate cross-league misidentification.
